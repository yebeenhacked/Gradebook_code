There are many parts to this Assignment.  Make sure you watch the videos linked in moodle.
///////////////////////////
Part1 :  create the classes or a diagram to figure out how to store the information.
Part2: implement the add section and change section methods
part3: implement the add student and add assignment to student methods
part4: implement the set score and get assignment score percent methods
part5: implement the mark tardy, get tardy, mark absent, get absent, and get contact info methods
part6: implement the add assignment to section method
part7: implement the get overall score method
part8: implement the get overall score average method
part9: implement the get assignemnt score average method

after every part (aside from part1) there is a mimir link so that you can test your code and make sure it works before moving on to the next part.

The Project:

To create a gradebook application (text based). The main requirements
 of the Gradebook are in the requirements section of this document.  
 For this assignment you do NOT need to implement the methods yet, they are 
 just there to help you understand how all the other fields interact if it 
 happens to be helpful,  all of these methods will end up being in the Gradebook class.

Requirements:

-The gradebook needs to keep track of different "sections"
-it should also keep track of what section is currently active ("being viewed")
-each section will have a section name to identify it.
-each section will have a different set of students.
-the gradebook needs to keep track of all of the assignments assigned to
	each student (each student might have different assignments)
-It needs to track the number of points possible, the name of the assignment
	and the number of points earned by the student for each assignment.
-It should also track the number of days a student has been absent and 
	number of days tardy
-It should also track the student's first and last name, student username, 
	and phone number.

Methods(external API - methods that will be exposed to user to allow the user
	to interact with your gradebook):  
	functions that return boolean values:(true means successful,
		false means it could not add/set etc)
	functions that return a double/int: -1 means username/sectionName/etc 
		could not be found)

changeSection(string sectionName); sets the currently active section

boolean AddStudent(String firstName, String lastName, string username, long phoneNumber); //creates a new student

double getOverallScore(String username) //returns overall score as a percentage for specified student

double getOverallScoreAvg() //returns overall score as a percentage for a section

boolean addAssignmentToStudent(String username, String assignmentName, int pointsPossible)

boolean addAssignmentToSection(String assignmentName, int pointsPossible)

boolean setScore(String username, String assignmentName, int pointsEarned)

double getAssignmentScorePercent(String username, String assignmentName) //returns score as a percentage for student in current section

double getAssignmentScoreAvg(String assignmentName) //returns score as a percentage for current section

boolean addSection(String sectionName)//creates a new section if there are not already 6 sections and sectionName isnt already used 

boolean markTardy(String username) //adds 1 to the students tardy count

boolean markAbsent(String username) //adds 1 to the students absent count

int getTardyCount(String username)  //returns number of times student was tardy

int getAbsentCount(String username) //returns number of times student was absent

String getContactInfo(String username) //returns string in the following format: "username:dbaker,firstName:David,lastName:Baker,phoneNumber:5172441344"
										//returns "notFound" if the username was not found

Assumptions:
You may assume that each student is only in one section.
